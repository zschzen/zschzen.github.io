**ðŸŒ³ Dynamic AABB Tree**

Iâ€™ve integrated a full dynamic AABB tree system into Dura2D, inspired by Box2D, and the performance boost was immediate.

**Whatâ€™s implemented:**

- **Surface Area Heuristic (SAH)**
  Balances the tree by minimizing the total surface cost. Instead of using height or node count, SAH makes smarter split and rotation decisions, reducing overlap and traversal steps.

- **Fat AABB**
  Each object has a slightly larger bounding box to allow small movements without triggering tree updates. This reduces the number of insertions and keeps the tree stable.

- **Memory Management**
  Nodes are managed through a fixed-size pool with a free list. No dynamic memory allocation during runtime, which improves stability and frame consistency.

**Result:**
The broad-phase is now fast, efficient, and scales well under load. Dura2D handles large scenes more easily, and the tree stays compact and responsive even with constant movement.
