**üõ†Ô∏è Quadtree Spatial Partitioning**

Optimized 2D collision detection and spatial queries using a quadtree in SDL2. Visual debug and performance logging reveal major gains over brute force.

**Key features:**

- Quadtree nodes with dynamic subdivision
- Efficient range queries for nearby objects
- SDL2 overlay of quadtree bounds and entities

Based on [The Coding Train‚Äôs Quadtree challenge](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/98-quadtree)
