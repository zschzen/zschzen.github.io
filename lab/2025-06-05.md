**ðŸ§© MOS 6502 Emulator Written in `C99`**

A clean and minimal MOS 6502 emulator built entirely in C99, focused on correctness, readability, and low-level understanding.

Whatâ€™s working so far:

- Full instruction set implemented and verified
- Accurate cycle timing and flag behavior
- Memory-mapped bus with support for RAM, ROM, and I/O regions
- Designed to be embedded into other systems or used for standalone programs

A foundational project to better understand how 8-bit CPUs work and how to build emulators from the ground up.
