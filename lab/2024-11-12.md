**⚡ Pathfinding Performance: A Testbed Optimizations**

I built a custom pathfinding testbed and explored 16,310 nodes in about 0.33 ms. Each colored pixel shows low‑level tweaks at work:

**Key experiments that unlocked speed:**

**Memory layout**

- Pack structs to remove padding
- Align hot functions to cut cache misses
- Pack frequent data tightly
- Add manual prefetching in A\* loops

**Compute optimizations**

- Inline distance math and use SSE2
- Ensure proper loop order for better cache locality

**Task control**

- Simple fiber‑based job system
- Time slicing to balance work
- Delay result gathering

Big thanks to [Perf Ninja](https://github.com/dendibakh/perf-ninja2024-11-11) for the low‑level inspiration. Still room to push this further.
