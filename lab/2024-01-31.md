**üïπÔ∏è Dura2D + LeveGL on PSP**

Running my own 2D physics engine (`Dura2D`) and minimalist OpenGL-style wrapper (`LeveGL`) on real `Sony PSP` hardware.

What I‚Äôve pulled off so far:

- **Libraries ported to pspsdk**, with all system dependencies replaced.
- **Rendering pipeline and physics adapted** for PSP's **fixed-function GPU** and **tight memory budget**.
- Demos successfully run at **full resolution on a PSP 3000**.

üì∏ Captured the result in a short recording real-time simulation and rendering, powered entirely by homebrew code.
