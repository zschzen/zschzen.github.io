**ðŸš€ Dura2D: Building a 2D Physics Engine for Learning**

I set out to discover how games simulate rigid bodies and collisions by coding my own 2D physics engine from scratch. Dura2D grew from a question: how do games deliver realistic motion and interactions?

Inspired by [Pikumaâ€™s course](https://pikuma.com/courses/game-physics-engine-programming), [Ming-Lun "Allen" Chou Game Physics blog posts](https://allenchou.net/category/physics) and [Erin Cattoâ€™s Box2D code](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d), Dura2D offers:

- Constraint System for joints and contacts
- Warm Starting to reuse previous frame impulses and boost stability
- Stable, realâ€‘time simulation across different scenarios
