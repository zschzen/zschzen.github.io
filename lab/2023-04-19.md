**🛠️ Unity: Multithreaded + Time Slicing + Delayed Result Gathering**

Experimenting with Unity’s Job System and Burst compiler to speed up line casts on a grid and update an exposure map in Unity. By leveraging _IJobParallelFor_, delayed result gathering, and frame slicing, I’ve hit some impressive numbers:

**What’s implemented:**

- **IJobParallelFor** jobs for parallel line casts
- Delayed result gathering on the main thread to avoid stalls
- Time slicing to spread work over multiple frames

**Inspiration:**
Based on [Ming‑Lun “Allen” Chou’s](https://allenchou.net/2021/05/time-slicing) approach in Unity’s Job System.
