**üïπÔ∏è Dura2D Running on a Nintendo Switch**

Got `Dura2D`, my custom 2D physics engine, running natively on a modded Nintendo Switch using the [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org) homebrew toolchain.

What‚Äôs been achieved:

- Ported core physics loop.
- Ran physics demos in real time on handheld mode.
- Kept it fast, small, and fully self-contained.

The project is an exercise in pushing homebrew boundaries while keeping the architecture minimal and portable.
