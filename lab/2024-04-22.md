**🛠️ Unreal Engine 5: Multithreaded Line Cast Exposure Map**

Experimenting with FRunnable to speed up line casts on a grid and update an exposure map in UE5. By combining FRunnable, delayed result gathering, and time slicing, I hit some impressive numbers:

**What’s implemented:**

- **FRunnable** tasks for parallel line casts
- Delayed result gathering to avoid main‑thread stalls
- Time slicing to split work across frames

**Outcome:**
Processed 10 percent of 1,024 line casts in just 0.52 ms per batch, all while keeping frame times smooth. 🎉

**Inspiration:**
Adapted the Unity Job System approach from [Ming‑Lun “Allen” Chou’s blog](https://allenchou.net/2021/05/time-slicing) to Unreal Engine.
