**🌫️ Explaining Ray Marching… with Ray Marching**

A meta-visual experiment: using real-time `ray marching` to **explain how ray marching works**, directly in the browser.

Features:

- A minimal SDF-based ray marcher using signed distance fields
- Interactive visualizations: orbit camera, distance debug view, and step tracing overlay
- Embedded directly into the blog post. The explanation _is_ the render

🎯 Goal: make an intuitive, visual-first introduction to ray marching that teaches by showing, not telling.
