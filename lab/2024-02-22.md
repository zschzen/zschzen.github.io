**ðŸ§© Chip0u: A CHIP-8 Emulator in `C++20` with `raylib` + `ImGui`**

A playful and modern take on the classic CHIP-8 virtual machine, written in C++20 with a focus on clarity and UX.

Whatâ€™s implemented:

- Full CHIP-8 instruction set with accurate timing and quirk handling
- Built-in debugger with step, breakpoint, and memory inspection
- UI built with `ImGui`, rendered using `raylib`
- Key remapping and save state support
- Loads and runs most public domain ROMs with zero config

Designed to feel light and responsive while offering deep control for learning and experimentation.
